* [2/2] Data selection & formatting
** DONE choose 100 videos from each class with regard to:
   - proper perspective
   - proper pose
   - proper resolution/focus/contrast - no motion blur...
   - only one person jumping
   - only male divers (no swimsuit)
   - diver is not occluded
** DONE extract in-air frames and prepare folder structure as required by Filip Ilic
* [1/3] Data preprocessing
** DONE Load pkl files from Filip Ilic
** TODO crop frame sequence to the actual pose
** TODO Artefact removal												:TBD:
*** Morphological: erosion/opening
* [4/5] Feature extraction and token selection
** DONE Find 3 largest (by volume) STVs
** DONE extract contours framewise
** DONE merge contours by STVI IDs and relative size w.r.t. largest contour
** DONE compute bounding box (MBR) framewise
** [1/1] for each selected STV, framewise:
*** DONE fit MBR to STV
*** [1/4] extract scalar features:
**** TODO Fill factor w.r.t. bounding box
**** TODO elongation or aspect ratio
**** TODO compactness
**** DONE Hu moments (or absolute Hu moments, due to possible reflection/flipped)
** TODO scale all features to range [-1;1]
* [0/1] Feature space filtering 										:TBD:
** TODO median filter on individual features
* [0/2] Classification
** TODO Conventional ML
*** TODO Support Vector Machine
**** autotrain with availible kernel functions
*** TODO k-Nearest-Neighbors
** TODO Neural Networks													:TBD:
*** Data loading & handling
**** do random train/test set split up and sequential batch extraction for variable size, OR:
* [0/2] Evaluation
** TODO Test accuracy of each class
** TODO Confusion matrix
