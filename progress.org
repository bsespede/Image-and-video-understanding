* [/] Data selection & formatting
** TODO choose 50 videos from each class with regard to:
   - proper perspective
   - proper pose
   - proper resolution/focus/contrast - no motion blur...
   - only one person jumping
   - only male divers (no swimsuit)
   - diver is not occluded
** TODO extract in-air frames and prepare folder structure as required by Filip Ilic
* [0/3] Data preprocessing
** TODO Load pkl files from Filip Ilic
** TODO crop frame sequence to the actual pose
** TODO Artefact removal												:TBD:
*** Morphological: erosion/opening
* [0/5] Feature extraction and token selection
** TODO Find 3 largest (by volume) STVs									:TBD:
** TODO extract contours framewise
** TODO compute bounding box (MBR) framewise
** [0/1] for each selected STV, framewise:
*** TODO fit MBR to STV
*** [0/6] extract scalar features:
**** TODO Absolute orientation angle
**** TODO Fill factor w.r.t. bounding box
**** TODO Distance to center of bounding box
**** TODO Bearing angle from center of bounding box to center of MBR
**** TODO elongation or aspect ratio
**** TODO compactness
** TODO transformation of all angle features
   - modulo pi
   - compute cosine
   - compute sine *2 -1
** TODO scale all features to range [-1;1]
* [0/1] Feature space filtering											:TBD:
** TODO median filter on individual features
* [0/2] Classification
** TODO Conventional ML
*** TODO Support Vector Machine
**** autotrain with availible kernel functions
*** TODO k-Nearest-Neighbors
** TODO Neural Networks													:TBD:
*** Data loading & handling
**** do random train/test set split up and sequential batch extraction for variable size, OR:
* [0/2] Evaluation
** TODO Test accuracy of each class
** TODO Confusion matrix
